Top-Level design
================
- Level design
    - Tile based
    - Open, city based (where towers are ICs)
    - Computers connected by information superhighways
        - Via hubs/switches.
        - Or peer-to-peer
        - Or some hybrid (perhaps you're directly connected to allies, but the
          opponent is accessible through a hub.
    - Building extra bases
        - Cell-phone based?
- Leveling
    - Start with a crappy computer, then do upgrades?
    - Stealing hardware from others.
    - Upgrades are something you have to go out and buy.
    - Currency is BitCoin based
- Economy
    - Your resources are based on your computer components
    - Individual constraints
        - Unit build speed
        - Individual unit speed
        - Fog of war
        - Your AI
        - Quantity of units
        - Buildings/chips
            - Some chips depend on other chips
        - Damaged components
            - Screen
            - Mouse
            - Keyboard
        - Unit upgrades
    - Speed, RAM, HDD space, power supply, Bitcoins (money, upgrade hardware)
        - HDD space
            - Records upgrades
            - Limits upgrades by HDD space
            - HDD knowledge can be stolen / transmitted!
        - CPU
            - Building speed (construction requires some CPU time)
            - BitCoin mining
            - AI
            - Allocated to software, which produces different type of units.
            - Sliders determine how you spend your CPU time between them.
        - RAM
            - Visibility
            - Quantity of units (like food)
        - BitCoins
            - Purchasing hardware only
        - Power Supply
            - Powers defense, buildings
            - Can place defenses freely, but you must eventually connect power
              if you want them to do anything.
            - If power supply is taken out, CPU goes into low power mode, rather
              than failing, otherwise it would be too easy to take people out.
    - Acquiring resources
        - BitCoins
            - Mined by CPU
            - Found on internet
- Attacks
    - Super attacks
        - 0-days
- Environment (random events)
    - Free random software mailings
        - Sometimes good, sometimes a virus.
    - Random events
        - Power surge
        - Power outage/brownout
- Races, if we decide to implement them, could be based on OS.

Map Design
==========
- Partitioning areas of the maps
    - Firewalls
    - Networks are connected by hubs.
- How you choose your base
    - Motherboard size
        - Start with 1000 BitCoins with the default configuration.
        - Size of your motherboard affects how many bitcoins you start with.
        - Larger motherboards can have more upgrades and expansions available
          later in the game.
        - Smaller motherboard's `goodness' maxes out early, large motherboards
          start out not-so-good but have much more potential.
        - Smaller motherboards start out easier to defend because of their
          size.
        - Bases are square
    - You choose/place CPU, HDD, RAM, power supply, screen, keyboard, mouse
      (but not NIC, you /must/ have one). You are forced to buy them.
    - Constraints
        - NIC must be at edge of motherboard.
        - You must run cables between components (at least the power supply);
          you can't build on top of the cables. This means that there must
          always be a path to every component for people to attack.
    - Motherboard color is your (individual or team) color.
- There are some NPC computers which you can hack into to abort them as a
  base. 
    - Can only use these for raw computing power.
    - Like a member of a botnet.
    - We still need to require people to defend their main base (to defend
      their monitor, keyboard, etc.), so we can't allow them to change which
      is their main computer.
- Defenses
    - Firewalls, in front of the NIC.
    - AV program has programs that just walk around attacking intruders.
    - Open traces, which consume more power, can zap enemies.
    - Resistors act as rough terrain, to slow things down.
    - Capacitors (super-)charge up your units.
    - Diode: A one-way gate that can be blown up.
- Attacking
    - Malware/viruses
    - Specific software that does certain things
        - One that puts holes in your firewall/whatever.
- Controlling units/base
    - Macro stuff will just coast along if you're not managing it directly.
        - This will leave you free to focus on micro at times.
        - Will allow you some home of fixing keyboard/mouse.
    - Hero units
        - Not critical, but show up occaisionally
        - Like a 0-day exploit
            - Effectiveness degrades over time
    - No direct control of units (except Hero)
        - Units operate in clusters.
    - P2P combat like Google Ant AI challenge.
    - Don't make unit control like DotA
