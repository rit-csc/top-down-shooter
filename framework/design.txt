Thoughts
========
- We need to implement States for our state machine
    - We need to write a simple stack based state machine
	- What methods will be common to all States?
	- Need a State interface
	- States will probably need to have some kind of intialization() and
	  update(), possibly also have onBecomeState() or similar methods
- How will we handle events that happen in our game?
    - Message passing seems promising, especially for a networked game
- Do we want to implement a simple window manager for our menus?
    - We could hard code them instead, but this is less flexible, also gives
	  someone something to do 
	- Fits in well with our message passing, (this is also the default way in
	  SFML)
